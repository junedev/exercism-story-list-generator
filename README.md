# Exercism Story List Generator

The scrappy script in this repo is used to generate the table on this page: https://exercism.org/docs/building/tracks/stories

1. Run the script with `node index.js` and Node version 18 or greater. It creates a file `exercises.md`.
2. Open the generated file and let the IDE formatting run over it to make the raw data look a bit nicer (e.g. via VSCode with "Markdown all in one" extension).
3. Open the markdown file in rendered view and check the result looks fine. If not, make adjustments to the script as needed.
4. Make a PR to replace the table in the source code with the new table from the file. https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/main/building/tracks/stories/README.md
